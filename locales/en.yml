        text: >-
          Scrum is a framework that allows us to find emerging practices in
          complex domains such as the management of innovation projects. It is
          not a complete process, much less a methodology. Instead of providing
          a complete and detailed description of how the project tasks should be
          performed, it generates a relational and iterative context, of
          inspection and constant adaptation where those involved are to create
          their own process.

          Retrospectives are meetings where teams identify areas for improvement
          and design actions to do so. They may occur at the end of each
          iteration (sprint), after each new version or anytime a need for
          improvement is detected. The following is a summary of techniques that
          can be used.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>You can download this e-book in PDF format

          The traditional management model is being replaced by more
          participatory, collaborative and humane ways of doing business.
          Organizations and teams are composed of people, and people have
          behaviours, emotions, desires, and their own history. If, instead of
          minimising these factors, we embrace them and included them in
          management, we’ll soon begin to witness dramatic improvements.

          Organizations and teams are composed of people, and people have
          behaviours, emotions, desires, and their own history. If, instead of
          minimising these factors, we embrace them and included them in
          management, we’ll soon begin to witness dramatic
          improvements.<br/><br/> Performance is not just about how much is
          produced, but how effective are the personal relationships in the new
          professional context. The formula is simple: <strong>R = R (Result =
          Relationships)</strong>. This means that the most effective way to
          improve outcomes is to improve relations between the members of a team
          and not just taking care of the processes and the tasks they
          perform.<br/><br/>But in this trip there will be a lot of challenges.
          To facilitate it, I decided to take the best of both worlds, Scrum and
          Coaching, and combine them in a novel way to make the teams to expose
          their spirit. by getting immersed in this reading, you will find
          experiences, innovative proposals, recommendations and useful
          description of a complete framework for knowledge
          workers.<br/><br/>This is a key moment in the history of the world of
          work. And many companies are already taking the big leap.
          <br/><br/><strong>Are you willing to learn this new way of working and
          relating?</strong>

Feature: English URL Validation
  As a customer
  I want to ensure that all English pages use proper English URLs
  So that there are no mixed language URLs like /en/recursos or /es/resources

  Background: Keventer
    Given I have data from Keventer API

  Scenario Outline: English menu pages should use English URLs
    When I visit "/en<english_url>"
    Then the page should load successfully
    And the page should be in English
    And the URL should not contain Spanish terms
    And the content should not contain Spanish terms

    Examples:
      | english_url                                    |
      | /                                              |
      | /services                                      |
      | /services/organizational-change-and-leadership |
      | /services/product-management                   |
      | /services/team-agility                         |
      | /catalog                                       |
      # | /schedule                                      |
      | /clients                                       |
      | /resources                                     |
      | /blog                                          |
      | /about_us                                      |
      | /certificate                                   |

# Scenario Outline: Mixed language URLs should not exist

## 2025-10-22: Mixed Language URL Redirect Implementation

### Summary
Implemented a comprehensive DRY solution for handling mixed language URLs and refactored all language-specific URL generation patterns throughout the application.

### Changes Made

#### Core Functionality
1. **RouterHelper Enhancement** (`lib/helpers/router_helper.rb`)
   - Added `translate_path` class method: Translates path segments between Spanish and English
   - Added `detect_mixed_language` class method: Detects and corrects mixed language URLs
   - Centralized route translations in `ROUTE_TRANSLATIONS` constant
   - Supports bidirectional translation for: recursos/resources, catalogo/catalog, servicios/services

2. **Mixed Language URL Redirect** (`app.rb`)
   - Added automatic detection and redirect in the `before '/:locale/*'` filter
   - Redirects `/en/recursos` to `/en/resources` with 301 status
   - Redirects `/es/resources` to `/es/recursos` with 301 status
   - Preserves full path with sub-routes (e.g., `/en/recursos/slug` → `/en/resources/slug`)

#### Refactoring
3. **Assessments Controller** (`controllers/assessments_controller.rb`)
   - Refactored to use `RouterHelper.translate_path('recursos', lang)` instead of hardcoded paths
   - Improved error handling redirect paths

4. **Training Controller** (`controllers/training_controller.rb`)
   - Refactored to use `RouterHelper.translate_path('catalogo', lang)` for catalog redirects
   - Applied to multiple redirect scenarios throughout the controller

5. **Resource Card Component** (`views/component/cards/_resource_card.erb`)
   - Refactored to use `RouterHelper.translate_path('recursos', lang)` for resource URLs
   - Ensures consistent URL generation across the application

6. **Resources List View** (`views/resources/list.erb`)
   - Refactored to use `RouterHelper.translate_path('recursos', locale)` for share URLs
   - Applied to social media sharing links (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn)

#### Testing
7. **RouterHelper Specs** (`spec/lib/helpers/router_helper_spec.rb`)
   - Added comprehensive tests for `translate_path` method
   - Added comprehensive tests for `detect_mixed_language` method
   - Tests cover all supported routes and edge cases

8. **Mixed Language URL Redirect Specs** (`spec/requests/mixed_language_url_redirects_spec.rb`)
   - New test file with comprehensive integration tests
   - Tests Spanish-to-English corrections (e.g., `/en/recursos` → `/en/resources`)
   - Tests English-to-Spanish corrections (e.g., `/es/resources` → `/es/recursos`)
   - Tests sub-route handling and path preservation
   - Tests that correct URLs are not redirected

### Technical Details
- All route translations are centralized in `RouterHelper::ROUTE_TRANSLATIONS`
- The solution is DRY and easy to extend with new routes
- Maintains SEO best practices with 301 permanent redirects
- Preserves full URL paths including query parameters and sub-routes

### Test Results
- All RSpec tests passing: 363 examples, 0 failures (83.5% coverage)
- All Cucumber tests passing: 232 scenarios (212 passed, 20 pending)

### Code Quality
- RuboCop found 906 offenses (657 autocorrectable) - existing technical debt, not introduced by this change
- No debug statements added
- All code follows existing patterns and conventions
